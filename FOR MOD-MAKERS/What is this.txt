If you're not a mod-maker... no need to mess with this.

This is a default Visual Studio solution setup for mod-making (v0.3)!

It has 2 projects: One is the API, which you should not edit, but can look into. And you can link to it from other solutions.
(Documentation in-progress.)

The other project is a basic default mod that basically shows how to Do The Thing. Poke around!

How to install mods:
Drop the resulting DLL (not the API) from builds into Assets/Mods/YourModFolderName/YourMod.dll
and then EnableMods in the config/

That's it!

Post in the discord if you have any questions!
