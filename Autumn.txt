Hey there!
You want to enable the official autumn season stuff in Desktop Goose?


- 'Mods' extend what desktop goose can do. They're contained in the /Assets/Mods folder.
-  My official autumn mod, which adds leaf piles, is already in the /Assets/Mods folder! So it will appear automatically in Desktop Goose after mods are enabled.

To enable mods:
  1. Open the "config.ini" file in Notepad
  2. Change "EnableMods=False" to "EnableMods=True"
  3. Restart Desktop goose

Again, once you do this, as long as the autumn stuff is you your /Assets/Mods/ folder, you'll be able to play in leaf piles!


I'm sure someone'll make a TikTok about it, or something haha.
If you do make a video about the autumn mod, let me know! I'm @SamNChiet on Twitter.

(also, there's a warning about mods that pops up when they're enabled - my autumn mod that comes with the goose is safe!)
